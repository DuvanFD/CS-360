- The Inventory App was designed to help users manage inventory efficiently by allowing data input, storage, and SMS notifications for inventory alerts. The app was implemented to address the business for businesses or individuals to track stock levels and receive alert notifications.
- To support user needs, the app includes several key screens and features. The Main Screen welcomes users and provides a clear navigation path to the login interface. The Login Screen implements authentication, ensuring secure access to the system. Once logged in, users interact with the Data Screen, and modify inventory data. Additionally, the SMS Notification Feature requests permissions to send alerts based on inventory stock limits, providing user awareness of low stock levels or other critical updates. One of the main challenges faced during development was integrating SMS notifications in a way that allowed the application to continue functioning even if the user denied permissions. This project was very helpful to learn the technical knowledge in Android development and also the valuable skills in UI/UX design
